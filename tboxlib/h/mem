/* File:        mem.h
 * Purpose:     memory allocation in the Toolbox
 * Author:      Ian Johnson
 * History:     6-Aug-93: IDJ: created
 */



/*
 * This is a central memory allocation place for the Toolbox core module.
 * A doubly-linked list of all allocated blocks is kept (maybe remove this
 * if using too much memory!).
 * To enable debugging of memory allocation, the calling functions should be
 * compiled without -ff, so that fn names are in the code area.  Compile
 * this code with -DDEBUG_MEMORY.
 * Memory tracing is turned on by setting the letter 'm' in the central
 * debug string (got by calling debugging('m')).
 *
 * Calling code will always call the debugging versions eg
 *       b = memory_allocate (1024, &fn, "some extra info");
 * Macros ensure the debugging code is removed.
 *
